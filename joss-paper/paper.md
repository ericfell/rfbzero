# Overview
`rfbzero.py` is a Python package for modelling redox flow battery... `rfbzero.py` currently allows for zero dimensional modelling of electrochemical cycling techniques and possible capacity fade mechanisms including:
<break this down further?>
- _CC_: constant current cell cycling
- _CCCV_: constant current followed by constant voltage cell cycling
- _degradation_: first or second order capacity degradation mechanisms
- _crossover_: crossover of redox-active species
